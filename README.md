# Asynchronous communication between Microservices with Kafka
This mono repo contains two microservices projects which I developed while making my article <a href="https://pedroluiznogueira.medium.com/kafka-with-java-spring-and-docker-asynchronous-communication-between-microservices-e1d00e120831">Kafka With Java, Spring and Docker, Asynchronous Communication Between Microservices</a> on Medium.
